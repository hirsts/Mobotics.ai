      purchase in the near future. This enables any existing zero turn mower to
      be upgraded to have autonomous capabilities and helps us all learn how to
      safely leverage autonomous solutions whilst cutting your grass with
      minimal effort.

    text: "We are developing a modular EV platform that can be reused for different
      activities, initially focused on green space management. Options are open
      to explore solutions for farmers and producers in the future to help with
      repetitive tasks and to de-risk the supply chain associated with seasonal
      labour. "
values:
  heading: Our Values
  text: "Electric Vehicles and Autonomous systems are set to impact all our lives
    but its currently the preserve of big business. Our objective is to open up
    the technologies to make them more accessible, reduce the barriers to
    adoption, and drive innovation around real world solutions that have an
    impact. "
